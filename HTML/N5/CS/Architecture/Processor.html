                    <h2>The Flow of Data in a Computer</h2>
                            <p>Computers receive information from input devices, like the mouse or keyboard, this data is then sent to the processor for processing. The processor then sends the results back to output devices, such as a monitor or speakers.</p>
                            <p>While the data is being processed, the processor may have to retrieve data from memory or storage, and it also may have to send data to memory or storage.</p>

                    <p>The flow of data is shown in the diagram below.</p>

The processor fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and then executes them, performing the necessary operations on data.</p>
                    <p>The processor actually consists of three main parts - the ALU, the Control Unit and the Registers.</p>
