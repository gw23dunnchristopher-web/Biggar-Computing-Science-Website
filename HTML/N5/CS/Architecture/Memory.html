                    <h2>What is Computer Memory?</h2>
                    <p>'Memory' is the name for chips inside the computer that store data and instructions. <b>Each location in memory where an instruction or data can be stored has its own unique address</b> that is used so that the processor can locate it.  There are two kinds of main memory in a computer, <b>RAM</b> and <b>ROM</b></p>                       
                    <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A type of memory that is used to store programs and data currently in use by the processor.  This includes an data that the user has loaded, or is currently creating.</li>
                        <li>RAM is a type of 'volatile' memory, meaning that it loses its contents when the computer is turned off.  This is the main reason why it is important to save files that you are currently working on before you switch off the computer.</li>
                        <li>There are different kinds of RAM with different read and write speeds, getting faster RAM is one of the ways to improve computer performance.</li>
                        <li>It is many times faster to retreive data from RAM than it is to retrieve it directly from storage.</li>

                        <li>This type of memory is 'non-volatile'.  This means that the data it contains is not lost when the computer switches off.</li>
                        <li>ROM can only be read from, the data on it cannot be changed.</li>
                        <li>ROM chips are built into the motherboard when it is manufactured.</li>
                        <li>These chips contain essential system files that are necessary for the computer to work.  For example, ROM chips will contain the BIOS, which tells the computer how to start up.</li>
