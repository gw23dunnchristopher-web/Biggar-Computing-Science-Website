                    <p>A computer bus is a communication system that transfers data between different components of a computer. It consists of a set of parallel wires or circuits that allow data, instructions, and power to move between the CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral devices.</p>
                    <p>There are three kinds of computer buses that you need to be aware of - data buses, address buses, and control buses.</p>

                                    <li>The data bus carries data between the processor and memory.</li>
                                    <li>It is <b>bi-directional</b> - this means that data can travel in both directions on this bus, from the processor to memory and back again.</li>
                                    <li>The width of the data bus is known as <b>word length</b>.</li>
                                    <li>The word length determines how many bits can be transferred between the memory and the processor at a time, so it influences computer performance.</li>
                                    <li>The word length also dictates how much data is store in each memory location.</li>

                                    <li>The address bus indicates which location in memory is currently being accessed by the processor.</li>
                                    <li>It is uni-directional, data can only travel along it from the processor to memory.</li>
                                    <li>The width of the address bus dictates the number of memory locations that the computer has.</li>
                                    <li>Number of Memory Locations = 2<sup>address bus</sup></li>

                                    <li>The control bus is a set of signals used to manage and coordinate the activities of the computer system components.</li>
                                    <li>It differs from the Address and Control buses because each wire on the control bus has a different function (for example: Memory Read, Memory Write, Clock Signals, Bus Requests, etc).</li>
                                    <li>It carries control signals from the CPU to other hardware components to ensure proper data transfer and execution of instructions.</li>
                                    <li>Some control signals are unidirectional (from CPU to other components), while others are bidirectional (communication between devices)</li>
                                    <li> It ensures data is transferred correctly by controlling the operations of the data and address buses.</li>
