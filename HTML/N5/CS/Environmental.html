                    <h2>The Environmental of Computer Systems</h2>
                    <p>Computer systems use a lot of energy, not just in terms of the energy it costs to run them, but also in terms of their manufacture, and they generate a lot of waste, which affects the environment.  Fossil fuels are burned when electricity is produced, which produces CO<sub>2</sub> that damages the ozone layer and is a contributing factor in global warming.  Additional factors to be aware of include:</p>
