                    <p>A program, or algorithm, is a series of instructions.  The
                        program will go through these instructions top to bottom, step
                        by step.  Selection is when the program has reached a point
                        where there is one or more options available to it, and it must
                        make a decision on which set of commands to execute.</p>

                    <h2>Boolean Operators</h2>
                    <p>In order to make a decision, a program has to have a rule (or 
                        criteria) that tells it what decision to make.  It does this by 
                        comparing one value to another, using comparison operators.</p>
                    <p>Boolean operators are used to compare two values.  The result
                        of the comparison is either true or false.</p>
                    <p>Here are a list of Boolean operators used in Python and thier 
                        meaning.</p>
                    <table style="max-width:500px; text-align:center; margin:20px auto
                        20px;">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Operator</th>
                            <th>Meaning</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>==</td>
                            <td>Equal to</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>!=</td>
                            <td>Not equal to</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&gt;</td>
                            <td>Greater than</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&lt;</td>
                            <td>Less than</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&gt;=</td>
                            <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&lt;=</td>
                            <td>Less than or equal to</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Note: Python uses '==' when comparing two values, rather than
                        '='.  This is because '=' is used to assign a value to a
                        variable.</p>
                    <h2>Simple Selection</h2>
                    <p>Simple selection is when the program has additional
                        code to run if a certain condition is true.</p>
                    <p>For example, a program that is calculating the total cost of a
                        meal may display that the customer will receive a discount, but
                        only <i>if</i> the cost of the meal is over £80.  The program
                        would have to look at the number stored in the mealCost
                        variable, and if that number is over 80, it would display the
                        additional message about the discount.</p>
                    
                    <p>The program would look something like this:</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print("Enter the cost of the meal:")</p>
                        <p>mealCost = float(input())</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>if mealCost > 80:</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;print("You receive a 10% discount on your next
                            meal!")</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>print("The cost of your meal is £" + str(mealCost))</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>This is a simple example, but this program would only display the
                        message about the discount if the mealCost that was typed in was
                        over 80. Note that you can tell which part of the code is inside
                        the if statement because it is <b>indented</b> (moved 4 spaces
                        from the edge).  You can try the example yourself in the code
                        window below.</p>

                        class="trinket" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    
                    <h3>Else Statement</h3>
                    
                    <p>The program can also be told what to do if the comparison is
                        <b>not</b> true.  We can add an 'else:' statement onto the end
                        for this. The code below is similar to the first set of code, 
                        but it will also tell the user if they have not spent enough to
                        receive a discount.</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print("Enter the cost of the meal:")</p>
                        <p>mealCost = float(input())</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>if mealCost > 80:</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;print("You receive a 10% discount on your next
                            meal!")</p>
                        <p>else:</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;print("Sorry, you will not receive a discount
                            this time.")</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>print("The cost of your meal is £" + str(mealCost))</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>You can try this yourself in the code window below:</p>

                    <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/f4897ed5f35d"
                        class="trinket" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    
                    <h3>Elif Statement</h3>
                    <p>It is also possible to add additional conditions.  In our
                        example, the customer would receive a 10% discount on their 
                        next purchase if they spend £80, but maybe they could receive a
                        smaller discount (5%) by spending over £50, and still nothing
                        if they spent less than that.</p>

                    <p>To do this, we would use 'elif' (else if) to add more conditions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print("Enter the cost of the meal:")</p>
                        <p>mealCost = float(input())</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>if mealCost > 80:</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;print("You receive a 10% discount on your next
                        meal!")</p>
                        <p>elif mealCost > 50:</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;print("You receive a 5% discount on your next
                        meal!")</p>
                        <p>else:</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;print("Sorry, you will not receive a discount
                                this time.")</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>print("The cost of your meal is £" + str(mealCost))</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>While it is possible to do this with multiple elif statements
                    rather than using elif, it is more efficient to use elif.  This is
                    because the program will stop checking the conditions on the if
                    statement once if finds a criteria that is met, rather than                             always having to check all of them.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can try this code in the window below:</p>
                    <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/13cf4f3daf00"

                    <h2>Complex Selection and Logical Operators</h2>
                    <p>A complex conditional statment has more than one condition. For
                        example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="codeText">if age >= 16 and town == "Biggar":</li>
                        <li class="codeText">if score < 0 or score > 0:</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Remember that a conditional statement like this will only run
                        the code inside them if the statement is True. In the first
                        example, with age and town, both statements would have to be
                        True for the over statement to resolve as True.  In the case of
                        the second example, either of the statements could be True for
                        the overall statement to resolve as True.</p>

                    <p>This is done using Logical Operators - AND, OR, NOT.</p>

                    <table  style="max-width:650px; margin:20px auto
                        20px;">

                            <th style="text-align:center;">AND</th>
                            <td>Both conditions must be true for the statement to be
                                true.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Only one condition must be true for the statement to be
                                true.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th style="text-align:center;">NOT</th>
                            <td>The condition must not be true for the statement to be
                                true. For example, '<span class="codeText">if not(found
                                    == True):</span>' (This means that the statement
                                would be true if the found variable were set to False)
                            </td>

                        the AND logical operator.</p>
