                   <p>In programming, a loop is a control structure that allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a 
                       condition or a specific number of times. Loops are used when you need to perform the same task multiple times without
                       writing the same code over and over.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Fixed Loop</b> - A loop that repeats a specific number of times.</li>
                        <li><b>Conditional Loop</b> - A loop that repeats based on a condition (e.g. it repeats either while a condition is 
                            true or until a condition is met.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Fixed Loops</h2>
                    <p>In Python a fixed loop is also known as a FOR loop.  Python uses the range() function to determine the number of times
                        that the loop repeats - range(startValue, endValue - 1)</p>

                        <li>When the loop executes for the first time, the iteration number will be set to the starting value in the range
                            function.</li>
                        <li>Each time the loop runs, the iteration number will be increased by 1.</li>
                        <li>The iteration number can be used inside the loop as a variable (displayed using the print function) to show how
                            many times the loop has executed.  This can also be useful to number the questions being asked in the loop.</li>
                    </ul>

                        code is indented beneath it.  The purpose of this program is to display all the number in a times table entered by

                    <p>In Python a Conditional Loop is known as a WHILE loop.  In a WHILE loop, the loop will continue to repeat the cod
                        inside it while a specificed condition is true. For more information on the kind of conditions you can use, please
