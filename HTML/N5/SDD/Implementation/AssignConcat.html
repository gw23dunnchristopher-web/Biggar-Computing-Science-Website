                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>One of the programming constructs that you must be aware of in N5 is the assignment
                        of a value to a variable.  This is where you store a value in a variable so that
                        it can be used later in the program.</p>
                    <p>The assignment operator is the <strong>=</strong> symbol.</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples of assignment:</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>age = 10</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The above code assigns the integer 10 to a variable called 'age'.</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>name = "Bob"</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This code assigns the string 'Bob' to the variable name.  Note that when using a
                        string, you must surround the string with speech marks.  This is to differentiate
                        it from other data types, since strings can use numbers, letters or symbols.</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>height = 1.8</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This code assigns the float (real number) 1.8 to the variable height.</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>found = False</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The code shown here assigns the Boolean value 'False' to a variable called 'found'.
                        As this is a Boolean value, it means that the variable can be set either to True
                        or False, indicating whether whatever you are looking for has been found or not.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>The input() function</h2>
                    <p>This function pauses the program and waits for the user to type something in.
                        When using the input function, you must remember two things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You must assign the input() function to a variable. If you don't then
                            whatever you enter will be lost.</li>
                        <li>The input() function automatically converts whatever you enter into a string.
                            If you want to enter a number, then you must use typecasting (int() or 
                            float()) together with the input() function.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here are a couple of examples of using the input() function:</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>name = input()</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>This code assigns whatever the user enters to the variable 'name'.  The name
                        entered will be stored as a string. </p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>age = int(input())</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Here we have entered a number.  The input function has been placed inside the
                         int() type casting function.  The input function will take in whatever the age
                        entered as a string ("10")# and then the int() function will convert it to an
                        integer (10).</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>height = float(input())</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>A similar thing has occured here, only this time the string taken in by the
                    input() function will be converted into a real number with a decimal point.</p>

                    <p>One more point to note about the input() function is that any string placed in
                        between the brackets will be displayed as a question for the user when the 
                        program is waiting for them to enter something:</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>name = input("Please enter your name: ")</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This code will display the string "Please enter your name: " and then wait for the
                        user to enter thier name. The name entered will be stored in the variable 'name'.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can use this or just use the print() function to display the question.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The print() function</h2>
                    <p>The 'print()' function is used to display a message on the screen.  The message to
                        be display goes in between the brackets. It should be noted that it cannot display
                        multiple datatypes unless they are separated by commas.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print("Hello World")</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>This code will display the message 'Hello World' on the screen. As the message is a
                        string, it is surrounded by speech marks.</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print(10)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>This code will display the integer 10 on the screen.  As it is an integer, it does
                        not need speech marks.</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print(True)</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This will print the word True on the screen, it does need speech marks as it is a
                        Boolean value.</p>

                    <h2>Concatenation</h2>
                    <p>Concatenation is the process of joining two strings together.  This is done by 
                        using either the + or the , symbol.</p> 
                    <p> The + symbol only works with strings, so any integers or floats used in the 
                        message must be converted to strings using the str() function.  Using + does not
                        automatically create a space between the two strings.</p>
                    <p>Using a comma instead of + will automatically create a space between the two
                        strings. Additionally, you can also concatenate different datatypes without
                        having to convert them to strings.</p>
                    <p>We typically use concatenation to insert values stored in variables into a
                        message. Look at the code below:</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>name="Bob"</p>
                        <p>print("Your name " + name + ".")</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This code will display the message 'Your name Bob.' The name "Bob" has been stored
                        in the variable 'name', and so using 'name' here will insert the value stored in
                        'name' into the message.</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>name = "Bob"</p>
                        <p>print("Your name is", name, ".")"</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This code uses the commas instead.  It will display the message "Your name is Bob
                        .".  There is an additional space before the full stop because the comma 
                        automatically creates one.</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>age = 10</p>
                        <p>print("You are " + str(age) + " years old")</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This code will display the message 'You are 10 years old' on the screen. The
                        number 10 has been stored in the age variable, so it can be used in the message.
                        The str() function has been used to convert the integer 10 into a string.</p>

                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>age = 10</p>
                        <p>print("You are", age, "years old")</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This is the same code using commas, note that there is no need to put the spaces
                        in yourself, or to convert age to a string using str().</p>

                    <p>The input() function can be used to get the user to enter information to be used 
                        later, for example in a message.</p>
                    
                    <div class="codeBox">
                        <p>print("Enter your age:")</p>
                        <p>age = int(input())</p>
                        <p>print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This code will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>display the message 'Enter your age:' on the screen.</li>
                        <li>get the user to enter thier age.</li>
                        <li>convert the string entered into an integer.</li>
                        <li>display the message "You are (age) years old." on the screen. With (age)
                            replaced by whatever number the user entered.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can try out the program in the code window below.  Feel free to copy and paste
                        the code above to try it or try your own commands.</p>
