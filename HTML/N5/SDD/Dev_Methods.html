                    <p>The method of software development you need to know at the N5 level is the traditional one - the iterative development process (also known as the 'waterfall' method.  If consists of six basic stages:</p>

                    <p>This is an iterative process - what that means is that you may need to return to an earlier stage because you realise that there is a problem with the program.</p>
                    <p>For example, when testing the program during the testing stage, you may need to return to the implementation stage.</p>
