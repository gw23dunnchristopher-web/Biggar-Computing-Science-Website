                        The National 5 Computing Science course in Scotland is designed to develop learners'
                        understanding of computational processes and thinking. It explores several central themes
                        through practical and investigative tasks across various specialized areas. The course
                        emphasizes the role of computing professionals as problem-solvers and designers, highlighting
                        the extensive influence of information technology on both the environment and society.
                    </p>
                    <p>The course aims to enable learners to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilise computational-thinking skills in diverse modern contexts.</li>
                        <li>Apply knowledge of fundamental computing science concepts and processes.</li>
                        <li>
                            Engage in the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation of various digital
                            solutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Effectively communicate computing concepts and clearly explain computational behaviors using
                            appropriate terminology.​

                    <h2>Assessment</h2>
                    <p>
                        The course is assessed through two main components: a <b>question paper</b> and an
                        <b>assignment</b>. The question paper is worth 80 marks, and the assignment is worth 40 marks,
                        for a total of 120 marks. Each of these is divided into three distinct sections, covering
                        <b>Software Design and Development</b>, <b>Web Design and Development</b> and
                        <b>Database Design and Development</b>. Completion of the Software Development section is
                        mandatory in both papers, but candidates can choose which of the other two sections they wish to
                        complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is a breakdown of the marks for the average question paper and assignment.</p>

                    <p>If you're getting ready for your National 5 Computing Science exam, the best way to revise is by breaking it down into simple steps. First, make sure you understand what’s actually in the course. Check the SQA course guide to make sure you know what topics to focus on.</p>
                    <p>It helps to use different ways to study so things stick in your mind. Flashcards are great for memorising key terms, like different types of loops in programming or important SQL commands. Mind maps can help you connect ideas, like how different parts of a database link together. Quizzing yourself is also a good way to check if you actually remember things rather than just reading over notes.</p>
                    <p>One of the best ways to prepare for the exam is by practising past papers. You can download them from this website, or the SQA website, and try answering questions under timed conditions. This gets you used to the types of questions that come up and helps you figure out what you still need to work on. Make sure to check the marking schemes so you understand what examiners are looking for—especially in coding questions where small mistakes can cost marks.</p>
                    <p>Since Computing Science is a practical subject, practising coding is super important. Try writing Python programs that use loops, arrays, and functions so you feel confident with programming questions. For databases, practise writing SQL queries using an online SQL editor or a database program. If web development is a tricky area for you, spend time building simple web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so you get more comfortable with it.</p>
                    <p>This website is intended as a revision resource for students stying Computing Science, but there are other online resources that you can use if you are struggling with a topic, such as:</p>

                    <p>YouTube also has a lot of videos that break down difficult concepts step by step.  Watching someone go through a coding problem can make it easier to understand than just reading about it!  I have included a Past Paper walkthrough in the form of videos on the Past Paper section of this website.</p>
