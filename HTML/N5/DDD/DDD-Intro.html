                    <h2>What is a database?</h2>
                    <img class="rImg" style="max-width:300px; height:350px;" src="/Images/N5/DDD/filingcabinet.jpg" alt="Filing Cabinet"/>
                    <p>A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Think of it as a digital filing system, where information is stored in a structured way so it can be quickly 
                        retrieved or modified when needed. Databases are used in nearly every aspect of technology, from websites and apps to financial systems and beyond.</p>
                    <p>Before computers became common in the workplace, it was common to use paper-based databases.  We used filing cabinets for this, and whenever we needed to get information from the database we had to open 
                        the filing cabinet and manually look through the files contained inside to find the information we needed.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays, we use computers to store and manage our databases, this has a few benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is much faster to search and sort the information in an electronic database.</li>                        
                        <li>Electronic databases help to ensure that there are no cases of duplicate data.</li>
                        <li>In paper databases, it was easier to incorrectly file a record, and only one person could look at a record at a time.</li>
                        <li>Electronic databases take up less space than computer databases.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Information and Data</h2>
                    <p>While when might use the words information and data interchangeably in everyday language, they are very different things in the context of databases.</p>  
                    <ul>    
                        <li>Data is the raw facts and figures, numbers and text that have no meaning on their own.</li>  
                        <li>Information is the data that has been processed and given meaning.</li>   
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, the data '200' has no meaning on its own, but the information '200 students' does.</p>


                    <h2>The Structure of a Database</h2>
                    <p>Databases are set out in Files, Records and Fields.</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Structure</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            <th>Example</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color:lightgreen; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">File</td>
                            <td>A file is a collection of structured information on a specific topic.</td>
                            <td>Information on all of the students in the school.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color:lightgreen; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Record</td>
                            <td>A record is a collection of structured information on a particular person or thing within that topic. A file contains many records.</td>
                            <td>Information on a single student.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color:lightgreen; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Field</td>
                            <td>A field is a single piece of data which is contained in each record. Records are made up of, usually, 2 or more fields. A record contains many fields.</td>
                            <td>The student's first name.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
        
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/databaseExample.jpg" alt="Database Structure"/>

                    <p>In this example, the whole table is a File, the rows are Records and the columns are Fields.</p>
