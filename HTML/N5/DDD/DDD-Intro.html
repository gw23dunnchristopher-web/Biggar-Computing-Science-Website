                    <h2>What is a database?</h2>
                    <img class="rImg" style="max-width:300px; height:350px;" src="/Images/N5/DDD/filingcabinet.jpg" alt="Filing Cabinet"/>
                    <p>A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Think of it as a digital filing system, where information is stored in a structured way so it can be quickly 
                        retrieved or modified when needed. Databases are used in nearly every aspect of technology, from websites and apps to financial systems and beyond.</p>
                    <p>Before computers became common in the workplace, it was common to use paper-based databases.  We used filing cabinets for this, and whenever we needed to get information from the database we had to open 
                        the filing cabinet and manually look through the files contained inside to find the information we needed.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays, we use computers to store and manage our databases, this has a few benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is much faster to search and sort the information in an electronic database.</li>                        
                        <li>Electronic databases help to ensure that there are no cases of duplicate data.</li>
                        <li>In paper databases, it was easier to incorrectly file a record, and only one person could look at a record at a time.</li>
                        <li>Electronic databases take up less space than computer databases.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Information and Data</h2>
                    <p>While when might use the words information and data interchangeably in everyday language, they are very different things in the context of databases.</p>  
                    <ul>    
                        <li>Data is the raw facts and figures, numbers and text that have no meaning on their own.</li>  
                        <li>Information is the data that has been processed and given meaning.</li>   
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, the data '200' has no meaning on its own, but the information '200 students' does.</p>


                    <h2>The Structure of a Database</h2>
                    <p>Databases are set out in Files, Records and Fields.</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Structure</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            <th>Example</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color:lightgreen; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">File</td>
                            <td>A file is a collection of structured information on a specific topic.</td>
                            <td>Information on all of the students in the school.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color:lightgreen; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Record</td>
                            <td>A record is a collection of structured information on a particular person or thing within that topic. A file contains many records.</td>
                            <td>Information on a single student.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color:lightgreen; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Field</td>
                            <td>A field is a single piece of data which is contained in each record. Records are made up of, usually, 2 or more fields. A record contains many fields.</td>
                            <td>The student's first name.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
        
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/databaseExample.jpg" alt="Database Structure"/>

                    <p>In this example, the whole table is a File, the rows are Records and the columns are Fields.</p>


                    <h2>Flat File vs Relational Databases</h2>
                    <p>A Flat File database contains only one table (file), and a Relational Database contains two or more tables that are linked together in a relationship.  When considering large sets of data, it is 
                    better to use a Relational Database rather than a Flat File Database because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It breaks the data down into smaller, more manageable data sets.</li>
                        <li>It is easier to update a Relational Database.  For example, if you have a database of people and cars, and you need to update a person's address you would just have to update it once on the person
                        table rather than having to do it for every car.</li>
                        <li>It avoids duplication of data, such as in the car example where you would have to enter the name of the owner over an over in a Flat File Database.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Primary Keys</h2>
                    <p>Each record must have a field dedicated to uniquely identify that record - this is known as the Primary Key.  The data stored in this field will be unique to each record.  For example, a database of 
                    customers could have an customer ID for each person, this would be used as the Primary Key for those records.</p>

                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/primaryKey.jpg" alt="Primary Key Example"/>
                    
                    <h2>Foreign Keys</h2>
                    <p>When you have a relational database with two or more tables, Foreign Keys will be used to link the tables together.  A Foreign Key is the Primary Key of one table which has been copied into another.  For
                        example, if a customer owns many cars then thier Customer ID might be used as the Foreign Key in a Cars table.  Their Customer ID on the record of any car that they own in the table, linking the
                        information about that customer to each car.</p>
