                    <h2>What is sorting?</h2>
                    <p>One of the useful features of a database is being able to organise the records based on the
                    different fields. For example, in a database of students you might want to sort all of the
                    records so that they appear alphabetically by last name.</p>

                    <h2>What is searching?</h2>
                    <p>In addition to sorting the records, you can also perform a search. This searches through the
                    database and only shows records that meet certain criteria. For this reason, searching the database
                    could also be called 'filtering' it, as it hides all of the records that don't containn the 
                    information that you're looking for.  An example would be searching a database of students, 
                    you could have the database only show you the students who are in 4th year.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Simple vs Complex</h2>
                    <p>When a search or sort is considered to be 'simple' it means that it only uses one field.  For example, sorting all of the students in 
                        the database by their last name would be simple sort, but if you wanted to sort them by thier last name and then thier first name 
                        (just in case two students have the same last name), that would be complex sort.</p>

                    <p>When searching a database, if you use just one criteria to search through the records - for example, searching for all of the students 
                        with over 90% attendance, that would be a simple search.  If you had two criteria though, for example searching for all of the 
                        students who are in 4th year and have an attendance of over 90%, that would be complex search.</p>

                    <h2>Sorting and Searching Tutorials</h2>
                    <p>Below are tutorials on how to sort and search a database in MS Access. For these tutorials, we will use a pre-constructed database of  
                        students.  You can download this database by clicking on the button below.</p>

                    <div class="button" style="margin:20px auto;">
                        <a href="/Files/Resources/N5/DDD/SQL-Students.accdb" download="SQL-Students.accdb">Access Students Database</a>
                    </div>

                    <p>Click on either Sorting or Searching below to see the tutorial on that skill.  Note that Searching is divided into Text and Number fields, this is because the options you get when searching 
                        different field types is slightly different.</p>
