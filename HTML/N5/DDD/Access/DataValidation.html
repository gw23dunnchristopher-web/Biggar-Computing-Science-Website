                       <h2>What is data validation?</h2>
                        <p>Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data entered into a database is valid.  This is done by setting rules that the data must follow, if the data does not follow the rules then 
                            it will be rejected and the user will be asked to enter the data again.</p>

                        <p>There are four types of data validation that you need to be aware of at the N5 level:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Presence Check</b> - Checks to make sure the user has entered data in the field before it allows them to create a record.</li>
                            <li><b>Range Check</b> - Checks to make sure that the number entered is within a certain range.</li>
                            <li><b>Length Check</b> - Checks to make sure that the user has entered a certain number of characters.</li>
                            <li><b>Restricted Choice</b> - Gives the user a list of options to choose from.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This page will give you a tutorial on how to set up each type of validation in MS Access.  Click on the buttons below to get information on each one.</p>

                                    <p>Setting the field length of a field in its properties will prevent the user from entering any more than that number of characters.  However, you may want the user to enter a certain 
                                        number of characters.  In Access, we can do that using the 'Len()' function.</p>

                                            <p>Click on the Short Text field that you want to make set the minimum length for.  In this example, I have selected the field for the Designer's phone number, which must be 11 
                                                characters long as phone numbers are 11 numbers with 0 at the start.</p>

                                            <p>In the properties for that field, click on the validation rule box and type in <b>Len([Phone Number]) = 11</b>.  The Len() function checks the length of anything in 
                                                between the brackets.  In this case we are checking the Phone Number field - the field name is typed in between square brackets.  We are saying to the program that the 
                                                length of the data in the specified field must be exactly equal to 11.</p>

                                                In this case, the message will say that the user must enter 11 characters for a phone number.</p>
