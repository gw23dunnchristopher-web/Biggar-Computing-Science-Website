                    <h2>What is MS Access?</h2>
                    <p>MS (Microsoft) Access is a database management system (DBMS) that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate databases. It is part of the Microsoft Office suite and is widely used for creating and 
                        managing  databases for small to medium-sized businesses and organizations.</p>

                    <p>In National 5 Database Design and Development, we will be using MS Access because it not only has a graphical user interface, making it a little easier to understand, but also access to a SQL view, allowing 
                        us to perform SQL queries in it as well.</p>

                    <p>In the MS Access Tutorials on this site, you will see how to create a new database, add and delete records, use data validation and create queries using the MS Access GUI.  First, we will look at the 
                        creation of a new database with two tables.</p>

                            <p><b>Open MS Access</b> - if you click on the Start button on your desktop (it looks like the Windows symbol) and 'Access' into the search bar, you should see it appear.  Click on it to open it.  The 
                                symbol for access is displayed here.</p>

                            a primary key field because of the small key next to it.  ID will be automatically be given the type 'Autonumber'.  We are going to change this to 'Designer ID' and set the field type to 'Short Text'.

                            design view, you will be able to see the properties of that field at the bottom of the screen (for more information on the properties of different field types, go to the

                            change it.  As per our data dictionary, set the length of the Designer ID to 6, Designer Name to 20, Email to 30 and Phone Number to 11.</p>

                                    <li>Description (Short Text, 50)</li>
                                    <li>Price (Number, but Access has a Currency type which is better for money)</li>

                            At this point you could start entering records, but we have some Data Validation to add first.  This will be covered in the next tutorial.</p>
