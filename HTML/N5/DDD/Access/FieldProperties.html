                    <p>In the Design View of MS Access, whenever you have a field selected the properties of that field will appear at the bottom of the page.  Different types of field have different properties, so if you
                    want an explanation of how changing these properties will affect the field, click on one of the field types below.</p>

                                <p>Short Text fields are the most common type of field, they are used for text that is less than 255 characters long.  The properties of a Short Text field that you will need to use at the N5
                                    level are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Field Size</b> - This is the maximum number of characters that can be entered into the field.  The default is 255, but you can change this to whatever you need.</li>
                                    <li><b>Default Value</b> - This is the initial value that will be entered before the user types anything, usually this is blank.</li>
                                    <li><b>Validation Rule</b> - This is the rule that will be used to validate the text entered into the field.</li>
                                    <li><b>Validation Text</b> - This is the text that will be displayed if the validation rule is not met.</li>
                                    <li><b>Required</b> - This is whether or not the field is required.  The default is No, but you can change this to Yes if you need the user to enter something in this field to create a 
                                    record.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Number fields are used to store numerical data, the type of numerical data can be adjusted in the properties.  At N5, you need to be aware of:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Field Size</b> - In a number field this is set to 'Long Integer', which is a number with no decimal places ranging from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.  This can be set to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Single - a decimal number that can store up to 7 decimal places (uses 4 bytes).</li>
                                        <li>Double - a decimal number that can store up to 15 decimal places (uses 8 bytes).</li>
                                        <li>Decimal - a decimal number that can store up to 28 decimal places (uses 12 bytes).</li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Default Value</b> - This is the initial value that will be entered before the user types anything, usually this is 0 in a number field.</li>
                                    <li><b>Decimal Places</b> - This sets the number of decimal places that the number entered will be rounded to. Initially this is set to Auto, which means it will not round the number until the 
                                        maximum number of decimal places for the field size is reached.</li>
                                    <li><b>Validation Rule</b> - This is the rule that will be used to validate the number entered into the field.</li>
                                    <li><b>Validation Text</b> - This is the text that will be displayed if the validation rule is not met.</li>
                                    <li><b>Required</b> - This is whether or not the field is required.  The default is No, but you can change this to Yes if you need the user to enter something in this field to create a 
                                    record.</li>

                                <p>Currency fields in access are a type of number field - they can be used to store amounts of money, but they can also be used to store percentages.  At N5, the properties you should be aware of
                                    are:</p>

                                    <li><b>Decimal Places</b> - This sets the number of decimal places that the number entered will be rounded to. Initially this is set to Auto, which is 2 for the currency field, but it can
                                    be set to go all the way up to 15.</li>
                                    <li><b>Default Value</b> - This is the initial value that will be entered before the user types anything, usually this is 0 in a currency field.</li>
                                    <li><b>Validation Rule</b> - This is the rule that will be used to validate the amount entered into the field.</li>
