                    <h2>SQL DELETE Statements</h2>
                    <p>DELETE statements are used to delete data from a database.  A DELETE statement consists of 2 main parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Specify the table that has the information to be deleted.</li>
                        <li>The criteria for which records to delete.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>DELETE Query - Layout</h2>
                    <p>All DELETE queries should have the following layout:</p>

                    <h2>Example</h2>
                    <p>For this example, we are going to use a database of Theme Park rides.  This database will contain two tables - Ride and Theme Park.  The Theme Park table will contain a list of different Theme 
                        Parks, and the Ride table will contain a list of rides at those theme parks.  The two tables are linked via the ParkID field.  You can see the tables below:</p>

                    <p>If you wish to download the Theme Parks database to try the query, you can download it by clicking on the button below:</p>
