                    <h2>What is GDPR</h2>
                    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation is a law that covers the suer and storage of people's personal data by any organisation.  Though it was originally drafted and put into practice by the
                    European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organisations everywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU.  It was put into effect on May 25th, 2018, and it
                    levies harsh fines and other penalties against people who violate its privacy and security standards.</p>

                    <p>The GDPR also sets out the rights that individuals have in regards to accessing and amending information that is stored about them.  When an individual gives information to an organisation, they
                    should be given clear details on what that organisation will use the information for.</p>

                    <h2>How does this relate to databases?</h2>
                    <p>Databases are used to store information and, when working with databases, it is very likely that at some point either a person's information will be introduced into your database.  Information
                    such as a person's name, thier telephone number, thier address and even their date of birth could all be considered to be quite sensitive, and therefor fall under GDPR.  If you are going to use someone's 
                    information, GDPR dictates that the person in question must first allow the use of their information and be told what it will be used for.</p>

                    <h2>Principles of GDPR</h2>
                    <p>GDPR has seven key principles that you have to be aware of:</p>
