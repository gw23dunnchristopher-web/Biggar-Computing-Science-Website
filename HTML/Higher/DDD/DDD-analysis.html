                    <h2>End-User and Functional Requirements</h2>
                    <p>During the analysis stage of Database Development, you should identify the following requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>End-User Requirements</li>
                        <li>Functional Requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>End-User Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Specific end user needs are considered when analysing the requirements prior to database development. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The end-users are the people who are going to be using the database.</li>
                        <li>Thier requirements are the tasks that they expect to be able to do using the database.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Functional requirements are the tasks that the database must be able to perform in order to meet the end-user requirements.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Processes and activities that the system has to perform.</li>
                        <li>Information that the system has to contain to be able to carry out its functions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These requirements will help:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>clarify the design of the database.</li>
                        <li>identify the features to be implemented on the database.</li>
                        <li>evaluate whether the system is fit for purpose after development is complete.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Worked Example</h2>
                    <p>Here is a worked example of the analysis stage of database development:</p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <p>
                            A travel agency wants to create a relational database to store the details of hotel bookings in Scottish Holiday Resorts.  The database will allow travel agents to view details of hotels and make bookings for 
                            customers.  Four separate entities are required:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Hotel</b> - used to store details of hotels in each resort.</li>
                            <li><b>Resort</b> - used to store details of Scottish holiday resorts.</li>
                            <li><b>Customer</b> - used to store details of customers who make holiday bookings.</li>
                            <li><b>Booking</b> - used to store details of hotel bookings.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            They have appointed a developer team to carry out an analysis of the database requirements. The
                            developers ask some of the travel agency staff about the features they would expect to see in the
                            completed database. The following are a few of the comments made by the staff:
                        </p>
                        <img class="cImg" src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Analysis/comments.png" alt="Staff Comments" width="80%">
                    </div>

                    <h3>End-User Requirements</h3>
                    <p>From the comments made by the staff, they want to be able to perform a range of searches to display:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>full details of any booking.</li>
                        <li>availability of hotels in a particular resort, with specified facilities (meal plan or pool).</li>
                        <li>details of hotels in a particular type of resort.</li>
                        <li>details of hotels available for a specified star rating.</li>
                        <li>resorts that have train stations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Staff should be able to sort search results in order of ascending order of price and should be able to
                    calculate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the total cost of any holiday booking.</li>
                        <li>the number of hotels within a certain price range or available on a certain start date.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
                    <p>From the end-user requirements, the developers have identified the following functional requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The relational database will have four tables - hotels, resorts, customers and bookings.</li>
                        <li>Each table will have a suitable primary key, with foreign keys linking the four tables.</li>
                        <li>In addition to the primary key and any necessary foreign keys, the following fields are required:
                            
                            <table style="max-width:400px; margin:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
                                <tr><th>Hotel</th><th>Customer</th></tr>

                                <tr><th>Resort</th><th>Booking</th></tr>
                                <tr><td>resort name</td><td>start date</td></tr>

                                <tr><td>train station</td><td>number of nights</td></tr>
                            </table>
                        </li>
                        <li>The database must use the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Simple and complex queries to search the database.</li>
                                <li>a simple sort to order the query results.</li>
                                <li>a calculation to work out the total cost of a booking.</li>
                                <li>an aggregate function to work out the number of 4-star hotels located in resorts that have a train station.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
