                    <p>
                        At the N5 level, you needed to be able to do the following actions using MS Access.  Click on the links below to check the relevant National 5 page
                        if you are unable to do any of these:

                    <h2>SQL Code at the N5 Level</h2>
                    <h3>What is SQL?</h3>
                    <p>You need to be aware of the following:</p>
                    <div class="sideBySide vertAlign">
                        <ul>
                            <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language.</li>
                            <li>It is a programming language that is used to manage and manipulate relational databases.</li>
                            <li>It enables the user to perform a variety of tasks in a database such as querying data, creating and modifying database structures.</li>
                            <li>MS Access is actually a GUI (graphical user interface) that allows the user to perform SQL functions without needing to use code.</li>
                            <li>You can access SQL View in MS Access by creating a new query and opening SQL View from there by clicking the SQL view button.</li>
                        </ul>
                         <img class="shadowImage" src="/Images/N5/DDD/Access/SQLViewButton.jpg" style="min-width:60px; max-height:100px;" alt="SQL View Button">
                    </div>

                    <h3>SELECT</h3>
                    <p>SELECT statements are used to retrieve data from a database.  A SELECT statement consists of 4 main parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The fields that you want to display in your results.</li>
                        <li>The table or tables that you want to retrieve the data from.</li>
                        <li>The criteria for your search.</li>
                        <li>The order that you want the results to be displayed in.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>All SELECT queries should have the following layout:</p>
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/SQL/SELECTLayout.jpg" alt="SELECT Layout">
                    
                    <h3>UPDATE</h3>
                    <p>UPDATE statements are used to update data in a database.  An UPDATE statement consists of 3 main parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Specify the table that has the information to be updated.</li>
                        <li>What the new values are going to be.</li>
                        <li>The criteria for which records to update.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>All UPDATE queries should have the following layout:</p>
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/SQL/UPDATELayout.jpg" alt="UPDATE Layout">
                    
                    <h3>INSERT INTO</h3>
                    <p>An INSERT statement is used to add a new record into the database.</p>
                    <p>For example, to add a new student to the Students table, we would use the command:</p>
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/SQL/INSERTLayout.jpg" alt="INSERT SQL Statement">
                    <p>
                        Note that the word 'year' is in purple here.  This is because 'year' is also the name of a function that can be used in SQL.  However, it won't    
                        actually affect this SQL statement.
                    </p>
                    <p>We specify the table name, then in brackets the fields we wish to insert to (you can add to all or only some).</p>
                    <p>Next, we must specify the values to add to the database.</p>
                    
                    <h3>DELETE</h3>
                    <p>DELETE statements are used to delete data from a database.  A DELETE statement consists of 2 main parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Specify the table that has the information to be deleted.</li>
                        <li>The criteria for which records to delete.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>All DELETE queries should have the following layout:</p>
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/SQL/DELETELayout.jpg" alt="DELETE Layout">
                    
                    <h3>Equi-Join</h3>
                    <p>
                        An Equi-Join is a type of join that is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.  The most common type of 
                        join is an INNER JOIN, which returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.  Foreign Keys are an example of this.
                    </p>

                    <p>For example, look at the tables in the Theme Parks database shown below:</p>
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/SQL/ThemeParks.jpg" alt="Theme Park Tables">

                    <p>
                        You can see that the "parkID" field appears in both tables.  SQL uses 'dot notation' to specify which table a field is in.  For example, the parkID 
                        field in the Ride table would be <b>'Ride.parkID'</b> and the parkID field in the Theme Park table would be <b>[Theme Park].parkID</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note that because the 'Theme Park' table has a space in the name, square brackets are used in the dot notation.</p>
                    <p>So how would you display the ride names and types for all of the rides in Thorpe Park?</p>
                    <img class="cImg" src="/Images/N5/DDD/SQL/EquiJoinLayout.jpg" alt="Equi-Join Example">
                    <p>
                        We are joining the results from the two tables using the parkID field.  It is a Primary Key in the Theme Park table, and a Foreign Key in the Ride 
                        table, so telling the database that we only want to see results where the parkID in both tables matches.  Once we do this, we can add other criteria 
                        to narrow down our search - in this case the query will check the Theme park table to see which record has the ParkName 'Thorpe Park'.</p>

                    <p>It will then look at Thorpe Park's parkID and only show records from the Ride table with that parkID.</p>
