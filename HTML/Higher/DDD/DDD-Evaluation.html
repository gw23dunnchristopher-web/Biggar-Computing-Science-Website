                        Once your database is fully developed and tested—ensuring that the user interface is functional and the SQL queries work correctly—the final step 
                        is evaluation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of the development process, you analyzed the requirements for the database. This involved:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying the intended end-user</li>
                        <li>Determining the needs of the end-user (the End-User Requirements)</li>
                        <li>Defining the database’s functional requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Evaluating the completed database means assessing whether it serves its intended purpose. This involves verifying that it meets its original 
                        specification by successfully delivering the required functions (as outlined in the analysis stage). Additionally, you need to ensure it aligns 
                        with the expectations and needs of the end-user. Reviewing test results helps in forming conclusions about its effectiveness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, in the case of the car dealership database from the Database Testing section of this website, the manager requested a 
                        system that stores customer details, vehicle information, employee information and sales records in a structured manner. Some functional 
                        requirements might include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A button to search for a specific customer and retrieve their purchase history.</li>
                        <li>A feature to display a list of all cars sold by a particular employee.</li>
                        <li>An interface that allows updating car prices based on promotions or discounts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If the database enables dealership staff to carry out these operations efficiently and the outputs are accurate (as confirmed by test results), 
                        it is considered <b>fit for purpose</b>. Additionally, if the user interface is clear and easy to use, the system successfully meets the end-
                        user’s requirements.
