                        An entity-relationship diagram is a graphical representation of the entities in a system. It is used to
                        summarise the relationship that exists between two or more entities. An entity-relationship diagram
                        indicates:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the name of each entity in the system.</li>
                        <li>the name of the relationship between two entities.</li>
                        <li>the cardinality of the relationship between two entities.</li>
                        <li>the attributes of each entity, if required.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>When drawing an entity relationship diagram:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the entities are represented by <b>labelled rectangles</b>.</li>
                        <li>the attributes within each entity, if they are required, are represented by <b>labelled ovals</b>.</li>
                        <li>the relationship between two entities is represented by a <b>labelled line</b> used to join the entities.</li>
                        <li>
                            one end of the line is forked in the case of the 'many' end of the relationship, this is known as <b>crows feet notation</b>.
                            Other representations do exist, such as labelling the ends of the line with '1' to indicate 'one' and 'M' to indicate 'many'.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Examples</h2>
                    <h3>Example 1: One-to-One Relationship</h3>
                    <img src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/ER1to1.JPG" alt="One-to-One ER Diagram" class="cImg"/>
                    <p>
                        This entity-relationship diagram illustrates the relationship between the two entities School and
                        Headteacher. A description of the relationship can be generated by reading across the diagram in
                        both directions:
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Each school is managed by one, and only one, Headteacher while each Headteacher manages one, and only one, school.</i></p>

                    <h3>Example 2: One-to-Many Relationship</h3>
                    <img src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/ER1toM.JPG" alt="One-to-Many ER Diagram" class="cImg"/>
                    <p>
                        This entity-relationship diagram illustrates the relationship between the two entities School and
                        Teacher. A description of the relationship can be generated by reading across the diagram in both
                        directions:
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Each School employs one or more Teachers and each Teacher is employed by one, and only one,
                    School.</i></p>

                    <h3>Example 3: Many-to-Many Relationship</h3>
                    <img src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/ERMtoM.JPG" alt="Many-to-Many ER Diagram" class="cImg"/>
                    <p>
                        This entity-relationship diagram illustrates the relationship between the two entities Student and
                        Subject. A description of the relationship can be generated by reading across the diagram in both
                        directions:
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Each Student studies one or more Subjects and each Subject is studied by one or more Students.</i></p>

                    <h3>Example 4: Worked Example</h3>
                    <p>
                        A relational database is used by a travel agency to store details of Scottish holiday resorts and hotels
                        in each resort. The database also stores details of customers and their hotel bookings. The Booking,
                        Customer, Resort and Hotel details are arranged in four separate entities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The following entity-relationship diagram illustrates the relationships between the four entities:

                        As exemplifed in N5, this Er diagram can be further expanded to include the attributes shown in the tables above:
