                    <p>
                        The following terms were covered at N5 level, and are still used at Higher level.
                    </p>
                  <table>
                      <tr><th>Term</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
                      <tr><th class="subheader">Entity</th><td><p>An entity is a person, place, thing, event or concept of interest to the business or organisation about which 
                          data is to be stored.  For example, in a school, possible entities might be Student, Teacher, Class and Subject.</p></td></tr>
                      <tr><th class="subheader">Attribute</th><td><p>An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity. For example, attributes of a Student entity might be
                      StudentID, First_Name, Surnname, and dateOfBirth.</td></tr>
                      <tr><th class="subheader">Primary Key</th><td><p>A primary key is an attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a record in an entity. 
                          For example, StudentID is a primary key for the Student entity. A primary key is signified by underlining in an entity-relationship diagram.</p></td></tr>
                      <tr><th class="subheader">Foreign Key</th><td><p>An attribute in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.  A foreign key is signified by an 
                          asterisk in an entity-relationship diagram.</p></td></tr>
                      <tr><th class="subheader">Relationship</th><td><p>A relationship is an association between two or more entities. For example, Students learn from Teachers 
                          and Teachers educate Students.</p></td></tr>
                      <tr><th class="subheader">Cardinality</th><td><p>The cardinality of a relationship defines the number of participants in the relationship.  It states the 
                          number of entity occurences in one entity that are associated with a single occurance of the related entity.</p>

                    <p>
                      Data Dictionaries were covered at the N5 level, and they are still used in Higher.  While the information shown in a data dictionary 
                      is the same, you will now be expected to be able to produce a data dictionary showing at least 3 entities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A data dictionary should contain:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of each entity.</li>
                        <li>The name of each attribute within each entity.</li>
                        <li>The type of data that will be held by each attribute.</li>
                        <li>The size of each attribute (for text attributes).</li>
                        <li>Indication of attributes that will be used as <b>Primary</b> or <b>Foreign</b> keys.</li>
                        <li>Validation rules that will be applied to any attributes.</li>

                    <h2>Validation</h2>
                    <p>Here is a small review of the types of validation found in N5.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Presence Check</b> - Checks to make sure the user has entered data in the field before it allows them to create a record.</li>
                      <li><b>Range Check</b> - Checks to make sure that the number entered is within a certain range.</li>
                      <li><b>Length Check</b> - Checks to make sure that the user has entered a certain number of characters.</li>
                      <li><b>Restricted Choice</b> - Gives the user a list of options to choose from.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram</h2>
                    <p>An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between tables that make up a database.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Entities</b> - The entities within the ER diagram are the names of the tables that will make up the database.</li>
                        <li><b>Attributes</b> - The attributes are the names of the fields that will be in the tables.</li>
                        <li><b>Primary Key</b> - An attribute that uniquely identifies each record in an entity.</li>
                        <li><b>Foreign Key</b> - An attribute that is a Primary Key in a different entity, linking the two entities together.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      There is more informaton how ER Diagrams are used at Higher level on the <a href="/HTML/Higher/DDD/Design/ERDiagram.html">Higher 
                      Entity Relationship Diagrams</a> page.
                    </p>
                  
                  <h2>ER Diagram Example</h2>
                  <p>Below is an example of an ER Diagram created using the data dictionary above.</p>
                  <img class="cImg" src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/ERDiagram.jpg" alt="ER Diagram Example"/>
                  
                  <h2>Cardinality</h2>
                  <p>Cardinality is the number of participants in a relationship.  There are three types of cardinality:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>One-to-one</li>
                      <li>One-to-many</li>
                      <li>Many-to-many</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    The Er Diagram above shows examples of One-to-Many relationships, because one teacher can teach many classes and one class can contain 
                    many students. We studied One-to-Many relationships in N5, but at Higher level we must also be aware of Many-to-Many relationships.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>One-to-One</h3>
                  <p>
                      In a one-to-one relationship, each entity occurrence in an entity is associated with one, and only one,
                      entity occurrence within a related entity. For example, a School is managed by one, and only one,
                      Headteacher, with a Headteacher managing one, and only one, School.
                  </p>
                  <h3>One-to-Many</h3>
                  <p>
                      In a one-to-many relationship, each entity occurrence in an entity can be associated with one or
                      more entity occurrences in a related entity. For example, a School employs many Teachers and each
                      of those Teachers is employed by one School.
                  </p>   

                  <h3>Many-to-Many</h3>
                  <p>
                      In a many-to-many relationship, several entity occurrences in an entity can be associated with
                      multiple entity occurrences in a related entity. For example, many Students study several different
                      Subjects and each of those Subjects is studied by many Students. Direct many-to-many relationships
                      between two entities cannot be implemented by a relational database system. To overcome this
                      problem, many-to-many relationships can be resolved to form two one-to-many relationships.
