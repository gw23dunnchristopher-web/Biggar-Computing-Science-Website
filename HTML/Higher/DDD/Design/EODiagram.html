                    <h2>What is an Entity Occurance Diagram?</h2>
                    <p>
                        An entity-occurrence diagram illustrates the relationships between the entity occurrences of one
                        entity, with the entity occurrences within a related entity. The creation of an entity-occurrence
                        diagram helps to identify the cardinality of the relationship that exists between the two entities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an entity-occurrence diagram, each entity is shown as a tall oval. Inside each entity, each entity
                        occurrence is represented by the value of its identifier and each relationship is illustrated by drawing
                        a line between associated entity occurrences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Examples of entity-occurrence diagrams are shown below.
                    </p>

                        The following table indicates which School is managed by which Headteacher and which
                        Headteacher manages which School.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From this entity-occurrence diagram, we can see that each occurrence in the School entity has an
                        association with one, and only one, entity occurrence in the Headteacher entity. Similarly, each
                        occurrence in the Headteacher entity has an association with one, and only one, occurrence in the
                        School entity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This confirms that there is a one-to-one relationship between the School and Headteacher entities.

                    <p>
                        From this entity-occurrence diagram, we can see that each occurrence in the School entity has an
                        association with one or more entity occurrences in the Teacher entity. We can also see that each
                        occurrence in the Teacher entity has an association with one, and only one, occurrence in the School
                        entity. This confirms that there is a one-to-many relationship between the School and Teacher
                        entities.

                        From this entity-occurrence diagram, we can see that each occurrence in the Student entity has an
                        association with one or more entity occurrences in the Subject entity. We can also see that each
                        occurrence in the Subject entity has an association with one or more occurrences in the Student

                    <p>
                        This confirms that there is a many-to-many relationship between the Student and Subject entities.
