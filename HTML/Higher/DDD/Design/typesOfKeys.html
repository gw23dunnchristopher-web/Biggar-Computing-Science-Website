                        In a database, a key is a field (or a combination of fields) used to uniquely identify records within a table. Keys are essential for maintaining data 
                        integrity, ensuring uniqueness, and enabling efficient data retrieval.  At the N5 level, we looked at Primary and Foreign Keys, but at Higher level we
                        also need to be aware of Composite and Compound Keys.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Primary Key</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is an attribute that uniquely identifies each record in an entity.  For example, in a school each student may have a student ID number.  This number could
                        be used as a primary key in a table of students because it uniquely identifies each one as shown below:
                    </p>

                    <p>The Primary Key attribute cannot be left blank when a record is created, it must have a value.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Foreign Key</h2>
                    <p>
                        A foreign key is an attribute in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.  This is used to link the two tables together.  For example, if a 
                        school has three houses - Stewart, Wallace and Anderson, and there is a table containing information about each house, then the name of the house could be used 
                        as a foreign key in the student table to show that each student belongs to a particular house.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/foreignKey.JPG" alt="Foreign Key" class="cImg"/>
                    
                    <h2>Compound Key</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, it is not possible to uniquely identify a record using a single attribute.  In this case, a compound key can be used.  A compound key is a combination of two or more attributes that are used together to 
                        uniquely identify each record in the table.  As an example, the table below is used to track which subject is using a particular room on partcular day and period.  None of these attributes are unique by themselves - multiple 
                        subjects use the same room, and multiple rooms are used on the same day and period.  However, when all three are used together, they can uniquely identify a record.  This is a compound key.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/compoundKey.jpg" alt="Compound Key" class="cImg" style="max-width:65%;"/>
                    <p>
                        Note that in the example, the combination of the data in the Day, Period and Room fields is unique for each row. Much like a Primary Key, a composite key cannot be left blank when you create a record - each of the attributes 
                        that comprise a compound key must have a value.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Composite Key</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the case of a compound key, none of the attributes can uniquely identify any records by themselves.  With a composite key, one of the attributes could be used to uniquely identify a records, possibly in a different table.
                        For example in the table below, StudentID can be used to uniquely identify a student, and ClassID can be used to uniquely identify a class.  A different table has been created to store the grade that the student achieved in a 
                        particular class, to identify which grade is connected to a class and student, this table uses both StudentID and ClassID together as a composite key to identify each record.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/Images/Higher/DDD/Design/compositeKey.jpg" alt="Composite Key" class="cImg" style="max-width:75%;"/>
                    <p>Note that the same ClassID can appear more than once in the grade table, and so can the same studentID, but each combination of classID and studentID is unique.</p>
