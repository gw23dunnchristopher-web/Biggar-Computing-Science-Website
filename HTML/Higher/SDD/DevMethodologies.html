                    <h2>The Iterative Method</h2>
                    <p>
                        The traditional method of Software Development is known as the Iterative Method.  This is also known as the waterfall method because it consists of
                        a series of development stages, flowing from the analysis stage to the final evaluation stage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is called the Iterative Method because it is an iterative process, meaning that it is repeated until the software is complete.  There is constant
                        revision and evaluation at each of the stages.  Large scale commercial projects have traditionally following this development process as far as 
                        possible in order to create successful products.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reasons it is used</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It evolved as software developers have attempted to reduce the time and money spent creating and maintaining the increasingly complex applications 
                            they are asked to create.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Commercial software development is a process undertaken by a team of people who need to be able to work together in a structured and efficient way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It ensures quality and efficiency in the final product.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Iteration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Iteration means to repeat. If a programmer is following the waterfall approach, they will revisit stages like design, implementation and testing fairly 
                        regularly. Programmers iterate because of new information, such as a test table with incorrect results.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Agile Method</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Agile method of software development is a set of principles and practices aimed at delivering software through iterative, flexible, and collaborative 
                        processes. Unlike the traditional iterative method, which often involve rigid, upfront planning and long development cycles, Agile focuses on continuous 
                        improvement, adaptive planning, and a high level of customer involvement.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Here are some features of this method:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Software Requirements are gathered as the software is being developed.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This is flexible, as specifications can change throughout the development process.</li>
                                <li>It results in reduced development time and costs.</li>
                            </ul>    
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prototyping:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Short iterations of work involve creating prototypes that are shown to the client.</li>
                                <li>
                                    The client gives feedback - face to face communication is highly valued as it is believed to lead to very well devised and highly effective 
                                    products.
                                </li>
                                <li>The developers can quickly respond if there are any changes to the requirements.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>There is greater customer collaboration and cooperation, often leading to more satisfied customers.</li>
                        <li>Emphasis is put on communication, team work, leadership and project management within the software development team.</li>
                        <li>The Agile Method suits the development of smaller projects.</li>
                        <li>It is less rigid than the waterfall method.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Reasons it is used</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If all of the requirements for the software can't be gathered upfront, the Agile Method is useful.</li>
                        <li>It is also useful if the requirments that have been gathered are likely to change.</li>
                        <li>It allows the development team to be flexible and advise the client if changes need to be made due to lack of time or budget.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Benefits of this method</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced development time.</li>
                        <li>Increased responsiveness to changing circumstances.</li>
                        <li>Reduced costs due to the efficiency of using small groups of developers.</li>
                    </ul>
