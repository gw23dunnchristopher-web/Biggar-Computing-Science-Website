                        At the N5 level, in the Analysis phase we had to identify the purpose of the software as well as the functional requirements (the inputs, processes and 
                        outputs).  At Higher level, we expand on that and, in addition to the functional requirements, we also have to identify the Boundaries and the Scope of 
                        the software.

                    <h2>Elements of Analysis</h2>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A general description of the purpose of the software.</li>
                        <li>Called the software specification - basis of a legal contract between the client (customer) and software company.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A list of what will be handed over to the client or end-user, for example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Design documents</li>
                                <li>Completed program</li>
                                <li>Test plan and test results</li>
                                <li>Evaluation report</li>
                                <li>Information on how long the project will take to create</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Boundaries</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defines the limits of the software, what is in the project and what is not.</li>
                        <li>Clarification of any assumptions made by the software developers about the client's requirements.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inputs, processes and outputs.</li>
                        <li>Any other features of the software or functions that must be delivered by the system.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>An app can be used to record two players’ scores on a 9 hole mini‑golf course.</p>
                    <p>A player wins a hole if they have fewer shots than their opponent. For example, 
                    Claire has won the first hole taking only two shots compared to Tina’s four shots.</p>
