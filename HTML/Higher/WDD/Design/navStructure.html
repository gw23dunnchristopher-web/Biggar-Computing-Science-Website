                    <p>
                        The design of a website should indicate the type of navigational structure that will be used — usually linear or hierarchical. The design should also  
                        show the direction of each of the links.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Linear Structure</b> - This is also known as a sequential structure, because the webpages follow a sequence, one webpage links to the next a 
                            which links to the next and so on.  These are traditionally used by businesses that don't have a lot of content.  There are no subpages.</li>
                        <li><b>Hierarchical Structure</b> - This is the most common type of structure.  It has a home page which leads to a set of top-level pages. Each of 
                            these pages can then have subpages.  This is the structure that we will be using at Higher Level.</li>         
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The <b>Shaded Background</b> shows pages on the horizontal navigational bar at the each page in the site are shown in this box (aside from the 
                            homepage). In this example it has been coloured yellow.  <i>The homepage is assumed to be on the navigational bar</i>.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Vertical lines</b> - show pages that can only be accessed from one page and only link back to that page.

                        The pages on the navigational bar are referred to as <b>Level 1</b> pages - they are coloured blue in the diagram below. The pages that can only be 
                        accessed from one of the pages on the navigational bar (the subpages) are known as <b>Level 2</b> pages - show here in light purple.  If the subpages 
                        had their own subpages, those would be <b>Level 3</b> pages, and so on.

                        A new video sharing website is being developed. This site should allow users to 
                        upload new videos to the site, watch uploaded videos and comment on them. Users 
                        should sign into the site using a username and password.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once signed in, users should be able to navigate to one of three pages — a profile 
                        page, a videos page and a settings page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From the profile page, users should be able to navigate to a page where they can 
                        upload videos and read comments left by other users, a page where they can edit 
                        their profile and a page where they can edit the details of previously uploaded 
                        videos.

                        recently.
