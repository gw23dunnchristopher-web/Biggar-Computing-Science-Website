                    <p>Evaluation is the final stage of the software development cycle.  Websites should be tested to ensure that they are both <b>Fit for Purpose</b> and  <b>Usable</b>.  Particularly when ensuring a website is Fit for Purpose,
                     you should return to the Analysis phase and look at the user and functional requirements that were identified at that stage.</p>

                    <p>
                        Fitness for Purpose is the process of ensuring that the website meets the requirements that were identified in the Analysis phase.  This is done by testing the website to ensure that it meets the user and functional 
                        requirements.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Usability</h2>
                    <p>A completed website may be evaluated as being “useable” if the site has met the end-user requirements identified in the analysis phase. This means that the website is easy to use and navigate, and that it meets the needs of the 
                        users.</p>
                    <p>Usability is often evaluated using the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Learnability</b> - How easy is it for users to learn how to use the website?</li>
                        <li><b>Efficiency</b> - Once users have learned how to use the website, how quickly can they perform tasks?</li>
                        <li><b>Memorability</b> - When users return to the website after a period of not using it, how easily can they re-learn how to use it?</li>
                        <li><b>Errors</b> - How many errors do users make, and how severe are these errors?</li>
                    </ul>
