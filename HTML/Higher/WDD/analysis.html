                    <h2>End-User and Functional Requirements</h2>
                    <p>During the analysis stage of website development, the following requirements should be identified:</p>
                    <p><b>End-User Requirements</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The end users are the people who are going to be using the website.</li>
                        <li>Their requirements are the tasks they expect to be able to do using the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Functional Requirements</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are the tasks that the website must be able to perform.</li>
                        <li>Also information that the system has to contain to be able to carry out its functions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These requirements will help to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>clarify the design for each webpage.</li>
                        <li>identify the features to be implemented on the website (videos, audio, images, search bar, naviation bar, etc).</li>
                        <li>evaluate whether the website is fit for purpose after development is complete.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Example of End-User and Functional Requirements</h2>
                    <p>Imaging that a new website is being created about lawn care.  The client wants the website to give users information on planting lawns, different
                    types of grasses, lawnmowers and fertiliser.</p>

                    <h3>End-User Requirements</h3>
                    <img class="rImg" width="25%" src="/Images/Higher/WDD/Analysis/lawn.JPG">
                    <p>Users should be able to...</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigate the website easily.</li>
                        <li>Find out information on two categories of grass with advice on which type to select.</li>
                        <li>Find out information about lawnmowers and how to select the right one for the right type of grass.</li>
                        <li>View photographs of different lawnmowers.</li>
                        <li>Find out information about organic and inorganic fertilisers.</li>
                        <li>Watch videos that will show them how to plant lawns - including sowing and turfing.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
                    <p>The website must contain:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a navigation bar that allows users to navigate the website easily.</li>
                        <li>a home page that provides internal links to different topic pages (Grass Types, Lawnmowers, fertiliser and Planting Lawns).</li>
                        <li>individual pages for each of the topics listed above - all of these should link back to the home page.</li>
                        <li>a heading on each page that clearly states what the page is about.</li>
                        <li>information on two different types of grass.</li>
                        <li>information on how to select the right type of grass.</li>
                        <li>images of different lawnmowers and information on each type.</li>
                        <li>video tutorials on sowing and turfing lawns.</li>
                        <li>information on organic and inorganic fertilisers.</li>
                        <li>links to pages that recommend organic and inorganic fertilisers.</li>
                        <li>Inorganic and Organic Fertiliser pages that link back to the main Fertiliser page.</li>

                    <p>
                        A new video sharing website is being developed. This site should allow users to 
                        upload new videos to the site, watch uploaded videos and comment on them. Users 
                        should sign into the site using a username and password.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Once signed in, users should be able to navigate to one of three pages — a profile 
                        page, a videos page and a settings page.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        From the profile page, users should be able to navigate to a page where they can 
                        upload videos and read comments left by other users, a page where they can edit 
                        their profile and a page where they can edit the details of previously uploaded 
                        videos.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        From the videos page, users should be able to view a page with the top ten 
                        trending videos and view a page showing the videos that they have watched most 
                        recently.
