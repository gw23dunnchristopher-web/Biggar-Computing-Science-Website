                    <h2>What are Intelligent Systems?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Intelligent systems are systems that use computers to make decisions and take actions based on data and information.  They can be used to improve 
                        efficiency, reduce costs, improve the quality of life, and help the environment.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                       When we look at the environmental impact of computers at Higher level, the focus is on intelligent systems and how they help protect the environment.
                       The three main types of intellgent systems we talk about are:
                   </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Heating Systems</b> - Smart heating that adjusts the temperature in your home automatically.</li>
                        <li><b>Traffic Control</b> - Traffic lights that change depending on the volume of traffice heading towards them from different directions.</li>
                        <li><b>Car Management Systems</b> - The Start/Stop system in a car that automatically switches off the engine when the car isn't moving.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Heating Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Smart heating systems are systems that use sensors to monitor the temperature in a room and adjust the heating accordingly.  They can be used to reduce
                        energy consumption and reduce the amount of CO2 emissions.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using the activity sensors, some smart systems learn the temperatures that you prefer in certain rooms and at what times.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring the activity in rooms can mean that the smart system adjusts the heating up or down depending on whether there is unusual activity in the 
                            house.</li>
                        <li>The thermostat is connected to wi-fi and can be manually controlled by using an app on your phone.</li>
                        <li>Allows you to turn the heating system off if you are not going home or to turn it on so that it is at the optimum temperature if you are coming home 
                            early, this saves energy as you are not using it to heat your home unnecessarily.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Traffic Control</h2>
                    <p>
                        Smart Traffic lights are a great example of an intelligent system.  They use sensors to monitor the volume of traffic heading towards them from different 
                        directions and adjust the traffic lights accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vehicles are considered one of the main contributing sources of greenhouse gas.</li>
                        <li>By reducing the amount of time that vehicles are stationary, the amount of CO2 emissions is reduced.</li>
                        <li>Vehicles consume greater amounts of fuel when they are constantly accelerating and decelerating.</li>
                        <li>Optimum speed for low fuel consumption and low emissions is between 45 and 65 miles per hour</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Intelligent transport systems use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>software and hardware, along with information and communications technologies, to improve the efficiency and safety of transport networks.</li>
                        <li>a variety of information from cameras and sensors, along with control of traffic signals, to try to keep traffic moving, reducing the amount of 
                            harmful emissions</li>
                        <li>Cars with individual navigation systems use satellite information on traffic flow to guide drivers away from traffic congestion and on to more free-
                            flowing routes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Car Management Systems</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numerous car management systems are used to reduce the impact on the environment.</li>
                        <li>Start-stop systems automatically shut down the engine when the car is not moving —
                        this reduces the amount of time the engine spends idling, reducing fuel consumption
                        and emissions. The car automatically re-starts when the accelerator is pressed, which is
                        most advantageous for vehicles that spend significant amounts of time waiting at traffic
                        lights or frequently come to a stop in traffic jams.</li>
                        <li>Engine control units use sensors to ensure the engine’s air/fuel ratio can be controlled very
                        accurately, ensuring optimum fuel consumption and a reduction of carbon dioxide
                        emissions.</li>
                    </ul>
