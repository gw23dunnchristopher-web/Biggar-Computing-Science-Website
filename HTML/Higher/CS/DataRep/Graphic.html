                    <h2>Advantages of Bitmapped Graphics vs Vector Graphics</h2>
                    <p>Each individual pixel in a bitmap graphic can be edited, this allows you to create some 
                        extremely detailed images.</p>
                    <p>Because you are just changing the colour of the pixels, adding more details or features to an 
                        image will not increase the file size.  The file size is solely based on the number of pixels 
                        there are and the number of colours that each pixel can represent.</p>
                    <p>Due to the amount of detail they can have, bitmaps are used for images with high amounts of 
                        realism.  Photographs are stored in bitmap format, for example.</p>

                    <h2>Disadvantages of Bitmapped Graphics vs Vector Graphics</h2>
                    <p>Bitmaps have a <b>fixed resolution</b> meaning that they can become blurry or pixellated when 
                        you enlarge them or zoom into them.  On the other hand, Vector graphics are <b>resolution 
                        independent</b> - this means that the image will appear just as crisp and clean no matter 
                        how much you enlarge it.  Vector images redraw objects every time you zoom in or change them in 
                        any way.</p>
                    <p>On a bitmap, you cannot move an individual piece of the image without leaving a white gap where 
                        it once was.  Vector images, however, are layered - you can move individual objects without 
                        affecting any of the other other objects in the image. Objects can even be placed in front of 
                        or behind each other.</p>
                    <p>
                        Operations such as resize, delete and move, which are available in Vector graphics, cannot be 
                        used as easily in bitmap graphics as only the pixels are edited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        File sizes for Bitmap graphics tend to be larger, as the size of the file is based on the 
                        number of pixels and the number of colours that each pixel can represent.  Vector graphics have 
                        a smaller file size as the file size is based on the number of objects in the image.</p>
