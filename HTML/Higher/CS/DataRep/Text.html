                    <h2>Extended ASCII vs Unicode</h2>
                   
                    <h3>Extended ASCII</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Used as the standard character code by many computers for decades.  As it is used by many 
                            computers it means that it is easy to transfer data between computers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            8 bits are used to represent each character.  This means that there are 256 (2<sup>8</sup> 
                            possible characters.  This includes non-printable control characters such as TAB or ENTER, and 
                            printable characters such as letters, numbers and punctuation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Standard ASCII also exists, which uses 7 bits to represent each character.  This means that
                            there are 128 (2<sup>7</sup>) possible characters.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Unicode</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Unicode is a standard that allows computers to consistently represent and handle text 
                            expressed in most of the world's writing systems.  It is an International version of ASCII that
                            includes non-English alphabets.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            So that it has enough space to account for the additional characters, Unicode uses 16 bits to 
                            represent each character.  This means that there are 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) possible 
                            characters, many more than ASCII.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, using 16 bits as opposed to 8 bits means that any text file using Unicode would 
                            take up twice as much space in storage as one using ASCII.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
