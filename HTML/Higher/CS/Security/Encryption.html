                    <p>You need to be aware of the following Encryption methods at higher level:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Asymmetric Encryption</b> - a secure communication method where a public key encrypts data and a corresponding private key decrypts it.</li>
                        <li><b>Digital Signatures</b> - a cryptographic method that ensures the authenticity and integrity of a digital document or message.</li>
                        <li><b>Digital Certificates</b> - an electronic document issued by a trusted authority to verify the identity of a user, organization, or website.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is a method of securing data by converting it into a code that can only be read by someone with the correct key.  Symmetric encryption is 
                        where the key (cipher) used to encode the data is the same as the key used to decode it.  However, at the Higher level you also have to be aware of 
                        Asymmetric Encryption, this is where the two ciphers, the one used to encdoe the data and the one used to decode it, are different. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of Asymmetric Encryption, the cipher used to encode the data is called the <b>Public Key</b>, and the cipher used to decode the data is 
                        called the <b>Private Key</b>.  Both of these keys are mathematically linked, so that the data encoded with the Public Key can only be decoded with the
                        Private Key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that the Public Key can be shared with anyone, and the data can be sent securely, as only the person with the Private Key can decode it. These
                        Keys are typically large prime numbers, which makes it computationally difficult to decode the data without the Private Key.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Digital Signatures</h2>
                    <p>
                        A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that is used to validate the authenticity, integrity and origin of digital data.  You can think of it 
                        like a paper signature,
                    </p>

                    <h2>Digital Certificate</h2>
                    <img class="rImg shadow" style="margin:20px; width:50%;" src="/Images/Higher/CS/Security/amazonCert.jpg" alt="Digital Certificate">
                    <p>
                        This certificate is issued to a website by a trusted third party called a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify the website's authenticity.  CAs include 
                        companies  like Verisign, Entrust, Geotrust and Digicert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a user visits a website, the browser checks the website's digital certificate to ensure that it is genuine.  If the certificate is valid, the 
                        browser will display  a padlock icon in the address bar, and the website will be considered secure.  If the certificate is not valid, the browser will 
                        display a warning message and the website will not be considered secure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The digital certificate contains:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a digital signature that was encrypted using a <b>private key</b> to confirm the identity of the server.</li>
                        <li>the server's public key that is used to...
                            <ul>
                                <li>decrypt the server's digital signature.</li>
                                <li>encrypt the data that is sent.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>details of the Certificate Authority (e.g. Digicert, Verisign, etc)</li>
                        <li>a uniquely identifying serial number, start date and expiry date</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Digital certificates prove that a website is legitimate and secure, and this increases customer trust. The customer can be sure that any communication
                        between themselves and the website is genuine and has not been intercepted or tampered with.  This is why you see the padlock icon in the address bar
                        of most commercial websites.

                    <h2>Digital Signature</h2>
                    <p>
                        Much like signing a paper document with your signature, the purpose of a digital signature is to guarantee that a digital document is actually from the
                        sender and is not forged.  It also ensures that the document has not been tampered with or altered in any way during the sending.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three algorithms used in this process:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Key generation algorithm</b> - creates a pair of keys, a public key and a private key.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Signing algorithm</b> - encrypts the data using the private key to create the digital signature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Signature verification algorithm</b> - decrypts the data using the public key to verify the digital signature proving that the sender is genuine
                            and that the message has not been changed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
