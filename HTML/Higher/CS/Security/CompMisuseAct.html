                    <h2>What is the Computer Misuse Act?</h2>
                    <p>The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) is a UK law that was introduced in 1990 to address the issue of Cybercrime.  It is designed to protect computer users and systems from unauthorised access, hacking
                    and other forms of Cybercrime.  The law itself has three main sections, which are outlined below.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Section 1: Unauthorised access to computer material</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This provision of the law makes it illegal to gain access to any computer systems or data on those systems without proper permission and authorisation.  It also covers any 
                                    methods that would be used to gain access - such as hacking, social engineering and use of malware.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><b>Section 2: Unauthorized access with intent to commit or facilitate a crime</b>
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This provision of the law makes it illegal to gain access to any computer systems or data on those systems with the intent to commit or facilitate a crime.  This is a more serious
                                    offence than the first provision, as it is a criminal act in itself.  This could include stealing data, distributing viruses or malware, or using the system to commit fraud.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Section 3: Unauthorized modification of computer material</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This section makes it an offence to modify computer material without proper authorisation.  This includes deleting, corrupting or altering data or programs.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                   
                    <h2>Penalties for Breaking this Law</h2>
                    <p>
                        The penalties for breaking this law depend on the severity of the crime.  For less serious offences the penalty could be a fine of up to £5000 or two years in prison.  For more serious
                        offences , such as those involing significant financial loss or damage, the penalty could be up to ten years in prison!
                    </p>

                                        computer repairman.  He used them to buy a pizza from Domino's, and denied having done so when challenged by the person he stole them from.
                                        These details were found on a mobile phone that he had on his person, and additional details on other people were found in
                                        a file called 'Bank Hack' on his computer when it was seized by police.
