                                <li>There has been a development of several sets of processor components in one microprocessor.</li>
                                <li>A dual core processor has two separate CPUs in one chip and a quad core processor has four separate CPUs in one chip.</li>
                                <li>The <b>more cores</b> a processor has, the <b>more sets of instructions</b> the processor can receive and process at the same time.</li>
                                <li>For example, a quad-core processor can be used to improve load times for web apps containing client-side scripts or multimedia elements.</li>

                                <li>By increasing the data bus from 32 wires to 64 wires, the computer can transfer twice as much data at one time.</li>
                                <li>Increasing the size of the data bus improves the system performance of the computer</li>

                    <h2>Cache Memory</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cache memory is a <b>very small amount of memory that is built into, or at least very close to, the processor</b>.</li>
                        <li>It can be referred to as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3, which indicates how close it is to the processor.  Level 1 is built right into the processor 
                            itself.</li>
                        <li>Cache memory contains frequently used instructions and data.</li>
                        <li>The processor checks to see if an instruction is in cache memory first (it checks Level 1, then 2, then 3) and if it is not in cache memory it goes to 
                            retrieve it from main memory.</li>
                        <li>It is much faster to read and write from cache memory than it is from regular memory because it is so close to the processor cores, so using cache 
                            memory can lead to an increase in computer performance.</li>
                        <li>Cache hit - Data is found in the cache and can be quickly retrieved.</li>
                        <li>Cache miss - Data is not found in the cache and has to be retrieved from main memory, which is much slower.</li>
                        <li>A larger cache will result in more cache hits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Clock Speed</h2>
                    <div class="sideBySide vertAlign">
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The processor's clock generates a series of 'pulses' at a constant rate, allowing everything that the processor does to be kept in time with the 
                                    clock.</li>
                                <li>One single pulse is known as a <b>Clock Cycle</b>.</li>
                                <li>The rate at which it generates these pulses is known as the <b>Clock Speed</b>.</li>
                                <li>The processor's clock speed is measured in <b>MHz (Megahertz)</b> or, more commonly, <b>GHz (Gigahertz)</b>.</li>
                                <li>A <b>1 GHz</b> processor will generate pulses <b>one thousand million times a second</b>.</li>
                                <li>Different instructions to the processer will take different amounts of clock cycles to fetch, but the higher your clock speed the faster the 
                                    processor can do this.</li>
                                <li>Increasing the clock speed of the computer's processor will speed up the rate at which it can fetch instructions, improving performance.</li>
                                <li>You can <b>overclock</b> a processor, manually increasing the clock speed, but doing so will generate a lot of heat and may damage the 
                                    processor.</li>
